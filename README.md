# Libremi

It's a play on words, library + RÃ©mi (my name)... I'm using some of these components and functions in many of my projets.

Here are some examples of components I've been experimenting on recently:

- `<artsy-block>`, a block with simple CSS generative art as its background

- `<color-picker>`, a color picker with multiple color spaces (RGB, LAB, OKLAB...)
